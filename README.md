# InactiveTimer

Sitting too long at Desk? This simple Project alerts you once every 30 mins to get up from your chair and move.

I am new to web development and thought why not develop a tool that is useful. I use this everyday.

The project uses Notifications API (HTML 5) to alert the User thus requires to be running under server. You can still use & run as local file but Window's alerts will be used instead.

## How to launch
You have two options
- Launch [Github page](https://rpuvvula.github.io/InactiveTimer/) OR,
- Host the files on a server or use Node.js to run them locally (instructions below). [More info on http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
  - 1> Have Node.js installed in your system.
  - 2> In CMD, run the command **npm install http-server -g**
  - 3> Navigate to the specific path of your file folder in CMD and run the command **http-server**
  - 4> Go to your browser and type **localhost:8080**. Your Application should run there.

## How to use
- Firstly, enable notifications by clicking Enable Notifications button
- and, Click start timer to get the timer going. That's it! It reminds you once every 30 minutes to get up

Do you have any suggestions and/or improvements to this tool? Let me know.
