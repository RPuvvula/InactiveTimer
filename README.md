# InactiveTimer

Do you spend too much time at your desk? This simple Project reminds you to get out of your chair and move every 30 minutes.

I'm new to web development, so I made this to teach myself while also being useful. I use it everyday at work!

The project uses the Notifications API (HTML 5) to alert the user, so it must be running on a server. You can continue to use and run as a local file, but Windows' alerts will be used instead.

## How to launch
You have two options
- Launch [Github page](https://rpuvvula.github.io/InactiveTimer/) OR,
- Host the files on a server or use Node.js to run them locally (instructions below). [More info on http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
  - 1> Have Node.js installed in your system.
  - 2> In CMD, run the command **npm install http-server -g**
  - 3> Navigate to the specific path of your file folder in CMD and run the command **http-server**
  - 4> Go to your browser and type **localhost:8080**. Your Application should run there.

## How to use
- Firstly, enable notifications by clicking Enable Notifications button
- and, Click start timer to get the timer going. That's it! It reminds you once every 30 minutes to get up
- Tip: Simply change the Interval input if you require a longer or shorter interval.
