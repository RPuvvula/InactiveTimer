# InactiveTimer

This simple Project alerts you once every 30 mins to get up from your desk and move.

The project uses Notifications API (HTML 5) to alert the User thus requires to be running under server. You can still use & run as local file but Window's alerts will be used instead.

- Host the files on a server or use Node.js to run them locally (instructions below)
  - 1> Have Node.js installed in your system.
  - 2> In CMD, run the command **npm install http-server -g**
  - 3> Navigate to the specific path of your file folder in CMD and run the command **http-server**
  - 4> Go to your browser and type **localhost:8080**. Your Application should run there.
